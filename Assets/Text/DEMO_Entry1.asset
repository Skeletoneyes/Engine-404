  - _Text: My name is Captain Olimar. While traveling through space, my ship was
      struck by a meteor... I must have blacked out, and I awoke on the surface of
      a weird planet. With so many parts lost, the skeletal hull of my beloved Dolphin
      is a painful sight. The engine is gone... I'm stranded.
  - _Text: To make matters worse, my atmospheric sensors indicate this planet's environment
      contains high levels of poisonous oxygen. My life-support systems can function
      for only 30 days. If I can't repair the Dolphin by then... No! Better not to
      think about it. I must find the missing ship parts!
