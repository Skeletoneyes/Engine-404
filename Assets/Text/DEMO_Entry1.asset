  - _Text: 'Welcome to the <b>demo</b> of Engine 404!


      This is designed to
      be a Pikmin fan-game-engine developed in Unity so that people can create their
      own <color=red>Pikmin experience!</color>'
  - _Text: 'I''ve designed the setup of scenes to be modular in a way you can easily
      add story elements, animations, enemies, Pikmin, change models, textures, etc.
      anything you want!


      The engine is very <i>work in progress</i>, so a
      lot of things are not finished and they wont be for a very long time. But we
      hope you can appreciate what we have right now, and what we''re aiming towards!

      Thanks from the Dev Team'
